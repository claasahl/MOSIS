- All [Configurable](https://github.com/claasahl/MOSIS/blob/develop/src/main/java/de/claas/mosis/model/Configurable.java)-classes:
	- parameters are defined at the top of the classes
	- the class constructor is used to initialize the parameters and setup their conditions
	- the setUp method is used to initialize global state variables (based on parameter values)
	- the dismantle method is used to cleanup global state variables
	- any method, function, constructor or type is to be documented (exceptions: @Override, etc.)
- All [Configurable](https://github.com/claasahl/MOSIS/blob/develop/src/main/java/de/claas/mosis/model/Configurable.java)-class tests:
	- implement a @Before and (optionally) a @After method (e.g. "public void before()" and "public void after()")
	- the @Before method will initialize a new Configurable instance (i.e. with parameters and calling "setUp()")
	- the @After method will dismantle the Configurable instance (if necessary)
	- implement tests for all relevant parameters and assumptions on their values
	- any method, function, constructor or type is to be documented (exceptions: @Test, @Overrider, etc.)
- All non-[Configurable](https://github.com/claasahl/MOSIS/blob/develop/src/main/java/de/claas/mosis/model/Configurable.java)-class tests:
	- are implemented as seen fit (e.g. test instances are not instantiated in @Before method but rather through a build function)
